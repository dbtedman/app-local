# Defines which repositories will be mapped into the VM and how.
#
# The key 'example' will be used in the url of the website, e.g. https://localhost:8443/example/.
# Change this to the name you want in the URL. The source is the location of the code on your
# development machine. Use '/' or '\' based on OS. The public is the path relative to the root of
# code as it will appear in the vm. It uses '/' here even if source is on Windows.

  example:
    source: '/Users/jane/Workspace/example'
    public: '/public'
